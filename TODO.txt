-(Optional) create encoder and decoder from other architectures (e.g; EfficientNet or MobileNet)
-Solve batch end too slow
-Make work in run_eagerly=False
-Make save weights work
-Make load weights work
-Solve loss=nan
-Update .gitignore for only datasets
-Solve memory issue
-Check and test entire pipeline
-Create video inference
-Add comments
-Remove pycache

There is an obvious problem with scale and input/output range. Why the official implementation does not
apply a sigmoid function or similar to the decoder?
